# Overview

This section of the documentation discusses the processes used when working on
the `analysis_server` package. Many of those processes are the same as the ones
followed when working on the `analyzer` package. The processes they have in
common are not duplicated here, so you should also familiarize yourself with the
processes documented in the `analyzer` package.

The documentation covers the following topics:

- [Implementing a new language feature](new_language_feature.md)
- [Running/Debugging analysis_server from source in VS Code](running_in_vs_code.md)
- [Profiling the analysis server hosted by VS Code](profiling_for_vs_code)
