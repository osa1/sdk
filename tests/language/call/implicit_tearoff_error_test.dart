// This test exercises a corner case of implicit `.call` tearoffs that is
// easiest to see through its effect on erroneous code.

// NOTICE: This test checks the currently implemented behavior, even though the
// implemented behavior does not match the language specification.  Until an
// official decision has been made about whether to change the implementation to
// match the specification, or vice versa, this regression test is intended to
// protect against inadvertent implementation changes.
