// This test exercises a corner case of list pattern handling where the type of
// the scrutinee is a nullable list. Prior to fixing
// https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/55543, flow analysis would fail to
// account for the fact that a list pattern might fail to match due to a list
// length mismatch, so it would incorrectly conclude that in the "match failure"
// case, the scrutinee was `null`.
